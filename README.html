<p>npm Exercises</p>
<p>Use the marked module</p>
<p>Install the marked module, require it, and use the module to convert some hard-coded markdown to HTML, you may use the example code provided in marked&#39;s project page.</p>
<p>Marked - part 2</p>
<p>Write a command line program that will take an input file and an output file argument, and convert the input file - which is assumed to be in markdown format - to HTML format and write to the output file. Example usage:</p>
<p>$ node convert_markdown.js README.md README.html
This should convert the README.md file to HTML and write the HTML version to README.html.</p>
<p>Note: you must use async I/O to do this exercise, and all the proper error handling must be done.</p>
<p>Speed Test</p>
<p>Install the Speed Test module globally and run it. Read the documentation on the project page to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>Lodash</p>
<p>Lodash is a swiss army knife toolbelt of a module. For example, there&#39;s a shuffle built in, and if you had known that, you could have used it for black jack and memory game.</p>
<p>Write a simple program that makes use of lodash&#39;s shuffle function.
Look through the lodash documentation for another function that is interesting to you, write a program that makes use of it.
Bonus: Request and Cheerio</p>
<p>Request and Cheerio are two useful modules and they can be combined to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>Figure out how to use both of these modules individually.
Use the modules together to grab the list of &quot;packages people &#39;npm install&#39; a lot&quot; on the npmjs.org front page, store the results in an array, and print it out to the terminal.
Bonus 2: Any module</p>
<p>Find any npm module and learn how to use it by reading its documentation. You can do a google search for something you might be interested in and add &quot;npm&quot; to the search term. Or you can look through this list for some inspiration.</p>
